A Home Assistant custom Integration for Cat Genie litter box devices.

# Installation:

The easiest way, if you are using [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/), is to install LocalTuya through HACS.

For manual installation, copy the localtuya folder and all of its contents into your Home Assistant's custom_components folder. This folder is usually inside your `/config` folder. If you are running Hass.io, use SAMBA to copy the folder over. If you are running Home Assistant Supervised, the custom_components folder might be located at `/usr/share/hassio/homeassistant`. You may need to create the `custom_components` folder and then copy the localtuya folder and all of its contents into it.


# Usage:

You must obtain a refresh token to use this integration.
